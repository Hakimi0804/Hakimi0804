Reach me out on [telegram](https://t.me/Hakimi0804)

Note: I am generally open to PMs but if your PM is something like "How to root", "How to unlock bootloader", "X ROM doesn't work" your PM will simply be ignored. I may also ignore your PM if it's a spam/something useless/scam/whatever I don't feel like dealing with.
